# Smart City Road Navigation System

## Problem Statement
The Smart City Road Navigation System efficiently manages city road networks, optimizes navigation, and plans cost-effective infrastructure. It leverages **graphs, trees, and advanced algorithms** to compute shortest paths, index city zones, prioritize road construction, and plan road networks.

## Objectives
- Gain knowledge of **Python/C++**, **trees**, **graphs**, and advanced algorithms.  
- Implement graph representations and **shortest path algorithms**.  
- Apply **topological sort** and **minimum spanning tree algorithms**.  
- Simulate real-world smart city transportation and logistics scenarios.

## Features
- **Road Network Representation:** Graphs (adjacency list/matrix).  
- **Shortest Path:** Dijkstra and Floyd-Warshall algorithms.  
- **City Zone Indexing:** Binary and AVL trees.  
- **Construction Priority:** Topological sort for one-way roads.  
- **Cost-effective Road Planning:** Prim’s and Kruskal’s MST algorithms.

## Implementation Steps
1. Define **Road Network ADT**.  
2. Represent road networks using **graphs**.  
3. Implement **Dijkstra** and **Floyd-Warshall** shortest path algorithms.  
4. Build **binary/AVL trees** for zone hierarchy.  
5. Implement **topological sort** and **MST** for planning.

## Learning Outcomes
- Apply graph and tree algorithms in smart city planning.  
- Understand shortest path computation, topological sorting, and MST algorithms.  
- Gain proficiency in efficient road network and zone management.
